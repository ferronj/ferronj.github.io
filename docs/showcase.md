# Project Showcase

This page is intended to showcase interactive projects and applications.

## Embedding Applications

Web-based applications can often be embedded directly into the site using an `iframe`.

For example:
```html
<iframe src="https://example.com/my-cool-app" width="800" height="600" style="border:1px solid black;">
  Your browser does not support iframes.
</iframe>
```
*(Note: Replace `https://example.com/my-cool-app` with the actual URL of your hosted application.)*

## Linking to Applications

Alternatively, you can link to applications hosted elsewhere:

[My Awesome Project](https://my-awesome-project-url.com)

## More Examples of Interactivity

Here are some simple interactive elements you can include:

=== "Content Tabs Example 1"
    This is the content for the first tab.
    It can include **markdown** formatting.

=== "Content Tabs Example 2"
    This is the content for the second tab.
    ```python
    # And even code blocks
    print("Hello from a tab!")
    ```

## Interactive Notebooks and Visualizations

Jupyter notebooks and interactive visualizations (e.g., from libraries like Plotly or Bokeh) can also be embedded directly into blog posts or pages.
