# Conway's Game of Life

This is an interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## How to Play
- Click on cells in the grid to toggle them between alive (on) and dead (off).
- **Start**: Begins the simulation, automatically advancing generations.
- **Stop**: Pauses the simulation.
- **Next Generation**: Manually advances the simulation by one step.
- **Reset**: Clears the grid and stops the simulation (or re-initializes with a random pattern, depending on implementation).

The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
