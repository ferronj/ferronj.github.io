## Project 4: Drug Discovery

**Objective:** Explore machine learning in drug discovery.

### Understand Drug Data:

- Learn about chemical structures, molecular fingerprints, and other features relevant to drug discovery.

### Implement a Predictive Model:

- Choose a drug-related dataset (e.g., molecular activity data) and build a predictive model.
- Explore techniques such as molecular docking and ligand-based virtual screening.
