## Project 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

**Objective:** Build a solid foundation in machine learning concepts.

### Learn the Basics:

- Study basic machine learning concepts, including supervised and unsupervised learning, classification, regression, and clustering.
- Familiarize yourself with popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

### Implement a Simple Classifier:

- Choose a simple dataset (e.g., Iris dataset) and implement a basic classifier (e.g., logistic regression or k-nearest neighbors) using scikit-learn.
- Evaluate and visualize the model's performance.
