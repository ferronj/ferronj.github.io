## Project 3: Deep Learning for Sequences

**Objective:** Gain experience with deep learning applied to biological sequences.

### Learn Deep Learning Basics:

- Study deep learning fundamentals, including neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

### Apply Deep Learning to Sequences:

- Choose a dataset containing biological sequences (e.g., DNA, protein sequences).
- Implement a deep learning model (e.g., CNN or RNN) for sequence classification or prediction.
