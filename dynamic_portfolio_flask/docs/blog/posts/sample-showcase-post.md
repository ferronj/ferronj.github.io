# Welcome to a Feature Showcase!

This post demonstrates some of the new capabilities added to this blog.

## Markdown Formatting

We can use **bold**, *italics*, and:
- Bullet points
- Like this one

## LaTeX for Math Equations

Here's an inline LaTeX equation: $E = mc^2$.

And here's a display style equation:
$$
\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.

Display style math:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

## Embedded Jupyter Notebook

Below is an example of an embedded Jupyter notebook:

{% raw %}{% import 'sample_notebook.ipynb' %}{% endraw %}


That's a quick look at some of the features!
