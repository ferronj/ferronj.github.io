## Project 2: Genomic Data Analysis

**Objective:** Apply machine learning to analyze genomic data.

### Understand Genomic Data:

- Learn the basics of genomic data and common file formats (e.g., FASTA, BED, VCF).
- Understand biological concepts such as DNA sequencing and gene expression.

### Implement Feature Engineering:

- Choose a genomic dataset (e.g., gene expression data) and preprocess it.
- Implement feature engineering techniques suitable for genomic data.

### Build a Predictive Model:

- Use machine learning to predict a relevant outcome (e.g., disease classification) based on genomic data.
- Optimize your model and evaluate its performance.


### Working Notes:


Chat-GPT output for project 2:

> Here are a few publicly available gene expression datasets you can consider for your project:

> - **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA):**
>   TCGA provides a comprehensive collection of genomic and clinical data across various cancer types. You can choose a specific cancer type and download gene expression data from the TCGA data portal.

> - **Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO):**
>   GEO is a public repository that hosts a wide variety of gene expression datasets. You can explore the GEO database and select a dataset related to a specific biological condition or disease.

> - **ArrayExpress:**
>   ArrayExpress is another repository for functional genomics data, including gene expression data. It covers a range of biological conditions and experimental setups.

> - **LINCS L1000 Data:**
>   The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 dataset provides gene expression profiles under various perturbations, such as drug treatments. It's particularly interesting for studying how gene expression changes in response to different conditions.
