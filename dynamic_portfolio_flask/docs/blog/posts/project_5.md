## Project 5: Integrative Systems Biology

**Objective:** Tackle a more complex project that involves integrating multiple data types.

### Data Integration:

- Choose a project that involves integrating diverse biological data types (e.g., genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data).
- Learn about methods for data integration in systems biology.

### Implement an Integrative Model:

- Build a machine learning model that takes advantage of the integrated data to make predictions or gain insights.
