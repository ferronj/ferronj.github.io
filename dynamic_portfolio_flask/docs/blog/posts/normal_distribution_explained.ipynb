    "# Understanding the Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Normal Distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a continuous probability distribution that is fundamental in statistics and the natural sciences. It is characterized by its symmetric, bell-shaped curve. Many natural phenomena, such as heights, blood pressure, measurement errors, and IQ scores, tend to follow a normal distribution. Its importance also stems from the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution."

    "## Mathematical Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x | \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $x$ is the variable.\n",
    "- $\\mu$ (mu) is the mean of the distribution, which determines the location of the center of the peak.\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ (sigma) is the standard deviation, which determines the spread or width of the distribution. A smaller $\\sigma$ results in a narrower peak, while a larger $\\sigma$ results in a wider peak.\n",
    "- $\\sigma^2$ is the variance."

    "## Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution has several key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Mean, Median, and Mode**: For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution ($\\mu$).\n",
    "2.  **Symmetry**: The distribution is perfectly symmetrical about its mean $\\mu$. The shape of the curve to the left of the mean is a mirror image of the shape to the right.\n",
    "3.  **The Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)**: This rule describes the percentage of data that falls within certain standard deviations from the mean:\n",
    "    *   Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean (i.e., between $\\mu - \\sigma$ and $\\mu + \\sigma$).\n",
    "    *   Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean (i.e., between $\\mu - 2\\sigma$ and $\\mu + 2\\sigma$).\n",
    "    *   Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean (i.e., between $\\mu - 3\\sigma$ and $\\mu + 3\\sigma$).\n",
    "4.  **Asymptotic Tails**: The tails of the curve extend indefinitely in both directions and approach, but never touch, the horizontal axis."
