        <p>I’m Joe. I have done a lot of different things, but underlying everything is a strong passion for biology and life's complexity.</p>
        <p>It took me a while to figure it out, so I’ve got to do a lot of it myself.</p>
        <p>That’s ok! I love learning and sharing what I’ve learned.</p>

        <p>I'm a chemical engineer by training. I spent several years working for a large pharmaceutical company,
        and then several more teaching middle school. This website is another blog or portfolio page from people like myself looking for ways to share
        their efforts and contribute to the conversation. I've long looked for my place in that conversation.</p>
        <p>My home projects generally fall under one of the following categories and they always
        lean toward things I can complete on a modest budget in a small apartment. Projects in the kitchen or on the computer.</p>

          <p>Most of my energy is going here. I live in a beautiful place building a powerful and thought provoking
          wine community. It's influenced heavily by the modern conversation around sustainable agricultural techniques.
          I view this as my lifes work and I intend to devote a lot of time here to my contribution to the local wine community. Life situation willing
          I will have a small winery of my own within the next several years. Stay tuned!</p>

          <p>When I was teaching a computer class about 3 years ago, I was looking for engaging projects for accelerated middle school students
          to work on and I found the <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/">Coding Train Youtube channel</a> from Daniel Shiffman and his book <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">Nature of Code</a>. I used some of it in class but
          I used it mostly for myself. I've worked through several of his more significant examples and this website was built so I can easily demonstrate
          my work with that material. None of my contributions are terribly groundbreaking, but I love the animations and the combination of biology and programming.</p>

          <p>A common theme...nothing I'm doing here is too groundbreaking, and electronics are quite a ways outside my core skillset, but I can
          occasionally make something useful for my other projects and I'll occasionally share that here.</p>

          <p>The dashboard page will be some live data that I'll practice displaying and it's likely something I am using myself.

        <div>
          <p>The website itself is new to me. I'm learning a lot as I go and that's kind of the point. When things are public it's easier to hold yourself accountable.
          I tried wordpress for a year and I thought that would be easier since it's pre-packaged. I found it bloated and difficult and it wouldn't work well
        with any of the digital projects I want to include. So I've worked off some common formats that others use (just trying to climb up onto the giant's shoulders)
        and just started typing. It's going to be entirely hardcoded to start so I expect something catastrophic to happen. Yippee of we go!</p>
